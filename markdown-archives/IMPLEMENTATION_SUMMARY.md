## 🎯 Validation Thresholds (Week 2.5)

```python
# In features/filter_smooth.py

Height:       > 100 px
Shoulder/Hip: 0.5 - 3.0
Torso/Leg:    0.2 - 3.0
```

**Rationale:**
- Filters partial detections
- Removes occluded poses
- Ensures realistic proportions

---

## 📈 Expected Performance

### FPS Targets
- **Week 2:** ≥ 15 FPS ✅ (tested: ~19 FPS)
- **Week 2.5:** ≥ 18 FPS ✅ (minimal overhead)

### Data Quality Targets (Week 2.5)
- **Outlier rate:** < 10%
- **Variance (SH):** < 0.1
- **Variance (TL):** < 0.1

## 🔄 Next Steps (Week 3)

### Recommended Actions

1. **Run full refined pipeline**
   ```bash
   python main_features_refined.py
   ```

2. **Review summary statistics**
   - Check `outputs/summary.txt`
   - Verify outlier rate < 10%
   - Confirm variance targets met

3. **Adjust thresholds if needed**
   - If too many valid frames filtered: Relax constraints
   - If too much noise: Tighten constraints

4. **Use refined features for Re-ID training**
   - Input: `outputs/features_refined.csv`
   - Higher quality data = better Re-ID model

5. **Consider parameter tuning**
   - Adjust `SMOOTHING_ALPHA` (0.1-0.5)
   - Fine-tune validation thresholds
   - Test on different video scenarios
