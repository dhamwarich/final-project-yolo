## 🔧 Calibration

### Default Settings

```python
ref_height_m = 1.70      # Person height (meters)
ref_distance_m = 2.0     # Distance from camera (meters)
ref_height_px = 360      # Pixel height at that distance
focal_length_px = 424    # Computed focal length
ref_ratio = 0.53         # Average adult torso/leg ratio
```

### How to Customize

1. Measure known person at known distance
2. Record pixel height from pose detection
3. Update calibration parameters in `main_reid_geometry.py`
4. Re-run pipeline

## 💡 Technical Highlights

### Hungarian Algorithm

- **Library:** `scipy.optimize.linear_sum_assignment`
- **Complexity:** O(n³) worst case
- **Purpose:** Optimal detection-track pairing
- **Benefit:** Better than greedy matching

### EMA Smoothing

- **Formula:** `value = α × new + (1 - α) × old`
- **Alpha:** 0.3 (balance responsiveness vs stability)
- **Applied to:** height_m, shoulder_hip, torso_leg
- **Benefit:** Reduces measurement noise

### Cost Function Design

**Weights rationale:**
- **0.5 for height:** Most stable metric across frames
- **0.4 for shoulder/hip:** Distinctive personal feature
- **0.1 for motion:** People move smoothly (prior)

**Normalization:**
- Height differences in meters (already scaled)
- Ratio differences unitless (0-1 range)
- Spatial distance normalized by image diagonal
